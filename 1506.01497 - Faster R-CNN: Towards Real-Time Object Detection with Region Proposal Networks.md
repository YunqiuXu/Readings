+ RCNN: 
    + Input image
    + Extract ROI(about 2000) from a proposal method : selective search
    + For each proposal, get features : CNN
    + Classification : SVM + Bbox regression
+ Fast RCNN: ROI pooling
    + Extract features from input images : CNN 
    + Get ROI: projected region proposals
    + ROI pooling: 
        + Layer input: feature map
        + Layer output: rois(rectangular vectors)
        + Cut each proposal as MxN parts, perform max pooling for each part
        + In this way we can get fixed number of features from each rigion
    + Classification & Bbox Regression: combined as a multi-task model
+ Faster RCNN: RPN
    + Extract features from input images : CNN 
    + Get ROI proposals from RPN
        + Predict proposals from features
        + RPN has classification and bbox regression as well, but rougher
        + Takes image features as input and outputs a set of rectangular object proposals(anchor), each with an objectness score
    + Send proposal and features to ROI pooling
    + Make final classification and bbox regression
