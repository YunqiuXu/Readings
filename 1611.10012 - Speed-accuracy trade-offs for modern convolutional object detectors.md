## 1611.10012 - [Speed/accuracy trade-offs for modern convolutional object detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.10012)
+ Other reference: http://blog.csdn.net/he_is_all/article/details/56485921
+ comparison between 3 models: Faster-RCNN, R-FCN, SSD
+ Brief theory of 3 models:
    + Single Shot Detector (SSD): 
        + Use a single feed-forward convolutional network to directly predict classes and anchor offsets 
        + Do not require a second stage perproposal classification operation
        + Faster RCNN(multibox and RPN part) also uses this approach to predict unknown-class box proposals
    + Faster RCNN:
        + Use RPN to extract fratures(region proposal) to predict box proposals
        + Use box proposals to crop features(the same layer of generating proposal), then feed features to fc6 and fc7 to predict class / class-specific box refinement for each proposal
    + Region-based Fully Convolutional Networks (R-FCN):
        + Do not crop features from the same layer where region proposals are predicted
        + Crops are taken from the last layer of features prior to prediction
        + In this way, the amount of pre-region computation is minimized
        + Faster than faster RCNN with comparable accuracy
+ Main results:
    + Build optimality frontier: 最优曲线, 到达该曲线上的精确度, 需要牺牲一定速度
    + For faster-RCNN: slowest but most accurate, can be faster by using fewer proposals while the accuracy does not change heavily
    + SSD: less sensitive to the quality of feature extractor
    + Some other comparison results can be seen in the paper
