## 1704.05548 - [Annotating Object Instances with a Polygon-RNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05548)
&hearts; DL , CV , RNN, Annotation
+ One of CVPR2017 best paper, an approach for semi-automatic annotation of object instances
+ Cast annotation as polygon prediction task $\rightarrow$ Polygon RNN
+ Why semi-automic
  + Human interfere can make it more accurate
  + We need to assign ground-truth bounding box first before predicting the position of polygon using RNN
+ Previous attempts
  + Learning segmentation models from weak annotation such as image tags or bounding boxes $\rightarrow$ in-competitive performance
  + Producing(noisy) labels inside bounding boxes with a GrabCut type of approach $\rightarrow$ cannot be used as official ground-truth for a benchmark due to its inherent imprecisions.
+ Polygon-RNN: predicts a vertex at every time step
  + Inputs:
    + $x_t$ : a tensor at time step t, concatenate multiple features processed by CNN
    + $y_{t-1}, y_{t-2}$ : previous 2 predicted vertices (one-hot encoding)
    + $y_1$ : the one-hot encoding of the first predicted vertex
    + $x_t$ and $y_{t-1}, y_{t-2}$ can be used to predict the direction of next edge
    + $y_1$ can be used to predict the stop position of this edge
  + CNN : a modified vgg16
    + remove fully-connected layers as well as last max-pooling layer(pool5)
    + add additional convolutional layers with skip-connections(see ResNet), this allows CNN to extract following features  
      + low-level information about the edges and corners $rightarrow$ follow the objectâ€™s boundaries
      + semantic information about the object $\rightarrow$ see the object
      + concated output features (28x28x512) $\rightarrow$ another 3x3 conv + ReLU $\rightarrow$ 28x28x128
  + RNN : 
    + Convoluntional LSTM
      + preserve the spatial information received from the CNN
      + reduce the parameters
    + model the polygon with a two-layer ConvLSTM with kernel size of 3x3 and 16 channels, which outputs a vertex at each time step
    + formulate the vertex prediction as a classification task.
