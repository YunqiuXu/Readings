## 1707.01629 - [Dual Path Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01629)
&hearts; DL , CV , CNN, Recognition
+ Championship of ImageNet 2017(Object localization for 1000 categories) 
  + Enjoy the benefits of ResNet and DenseNet, bridge the densely connected networks with HORNN
  + Shares common features while maintaining the flexibility to explore new features through dual path architectures
  + Advantages
    + Effective feature reusage and reexploitation
    + Higher parameter efficiency, lower computational cost and lower memory consumption
    + Friendly for optimization
+ ResNet, DenseNet and HORNN
  + Terminologies:
    + t: t-th step
    + k: the index of current step
    + F: Feature extracting function, inputs hidden state, outputs extracted information
    + G: Transformation function, transforms gathered information to current hidden state
  + Observations:
    + If for all k, F and G are shared $\rightarrow$ ResNet and DenseNet can be seen as HORNN
    + If for all k,t, F is shared $\rightarrow$ ResNet can be seen as DenseNet
+ DPN
  + It will be easier to understand via codes, although it's still in progress: https://github.com/cypw/DPNs
