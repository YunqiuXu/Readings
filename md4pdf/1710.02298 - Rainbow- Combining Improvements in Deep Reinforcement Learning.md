## 1. Introduction
+ Examines six extensions to the DQN algorithm as well as their combination
+ Rainbow: 
    + An agent that combines all the ingredients
    + Shows best performance on Atari 2600 benchmark, both in terms of data efficiency and final performance
    + Shows the contribution of each component to overall per-
formance

|Network|What's new|
|-----|
|DQN|CNN; experience replay; target network|
|DDQN|decoupling selection + evaluation of the bootstrap action $\rightarrow$ handle overestimation
|Prioritization|Improves data efficiency|
|Dueling DQN|Advantage function|
|A3C|shifts the bias-variance tradeoff ; propagate newly observed rewards faster to earlier visited states|
|Distributed DQN|learns a categorical distribution of discounted returns, instead of estimating the mean|
|Noisy DQN| uses stochastic network layers for exploration|
